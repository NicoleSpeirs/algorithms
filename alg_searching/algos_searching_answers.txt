Short Answer

1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

Finding a specific card in unsorted deck of cards.

2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

Searching for a word in a dictionary.

3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

To find G using the linear search would take 7 iterations.

4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

To find G using binary search would take 3 iterations.

5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

Given unsorted collection I would chose the linear search because it still will be faster than sorting the collection first and then trying to use binary search.

6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

For sorted collection of a million items I would use binary search since it will divide the collection in half with each iteration thus would be much faster than iterating through each item using linear search.

Programming Assignment:
1. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

function findWord(collection, word){
  let low = 0;
  let high = collection.length - 1;
  while (low <= high) {
    let mid = Math.round((low + high)/ 2);

    if (collection[mid] > word){
      high = mid - 1;
    } else if (collection[mid] < word){
      low = mid + 1;
    } else {
      return word;
    }
  }
  return "word is not found!";
}


let collection = ["albany", "albarello", "albarium", "albata", "albategnius", "albatross", "albay", "albedo", "albedometer", "albee"]
console.log(findWord(collection, "albatross"));

2. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

function findFish(collection, fish){
  for(var i = 0; i < collection.length; i ++){
    value = collection[i];
    if (value === fish){
     return value;
    }
  }
  return "fish not found";
}

let collection = ["yellow fish", "red fish", "gold and white", "white-spotted goldfish", "rainbow-fish"];

console.log(findFish(collection,"white-spotted goldfish"));
